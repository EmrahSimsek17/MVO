The content will be completed after the article is published.


# Readme
- This is an official Python implementation of article ...
- Model
    - ![]()

## Usage
- Download KITTI data
	- This shell ```KITTI/downloader.sh``` can be used to download the KITTI images and pretrained model
		- the shell will only keep the left camera color images (image_03 folder) and delete other data
		- the downloaded images will be placed at ```KITTI/images/00/```, ```KITTI/images/01```, ...
	- Download the ground truth pose from [KITTI Visual Odometry](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php)
		- you need to enter your email to request the pose data [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_odometry_poses.zip)
		- and place the ground truth pose at ```KITTI/pose_GT/```
